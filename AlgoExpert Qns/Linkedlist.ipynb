The input Nodes can be either stand-alone nodes ot nodes that are already in the linked list. If they're nodes that are already in the linkedlist, the methods will effectively be moving the nodes within the linkedlist. You won't be told if the input ndes are already in the linkedlist, so your code will have to defensively handle this scenario.\r\n",
