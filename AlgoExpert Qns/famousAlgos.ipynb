    "Bellman Ford Algo is an algo which is used to solve shortest path problems in graphs. The first code walkthrough will make sense, and then it follows the leetcode problem. Cheapest flight within k stops\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SO the idea is you initialize the price to be inf for all the stops except the src and then travel (v-1) where v is the number of verteces. \n",
    "then have a temp array called tempPrices which is a copy of prices at that point.\n",
    "and on each iteration, check if the price at that station is inf, if it is then continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if its not check if the price at that stop + the price is less than the tempprice at the dest, if it is then update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "then update the price to be tempprice"
